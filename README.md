# Data-Analysis-Professional-Nanodegree-Program

## Explore US Bikeshare Data
In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems
for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City, and Washington. You will 
write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics.
You will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

## Investigate No show appointment Dataset
For the final project, you will conduct your own data analysis and create 
a file to share that documents your findings. You should start by taking a look at your 
dataset and brainstorming what questions you could answer using it. Then you should use pandas
and NumPy to answer the questions you are most interested in, and create a report sharing the answers.
You will not be required to use inferential statistics or machine learning to complete this project, 
but you should make it clear in your communications that your findings are tentative. This project is open-ended 
in that we are not looking for one right answer.
